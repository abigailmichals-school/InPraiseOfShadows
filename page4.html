      <h2>Of course the Japanese room does have its picture alcove,</h2>
      <h2>and in it a hanging scroll and a flower arrangement.</h2>
      <h2>But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament but rather to give depth to the shadows.</h2>  
      <h2>We value a scroll above all for the way it blends with the walls of the alcove,</h2>
      <h2>and thus we consider the mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. </h2>
      <h2>Even the greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to blend with the alcove,</h2>
      <h2>while a work of no particular distinction may blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both itself and its surroundings.</h2>
      <h2>Wherein lies the power of an otherwise ordinary work to produce such an effect?</h2>
      <h2>Most often the paper,</h2>
      <h2>the ink,</h2>
      <h2> the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity,</h2>
      <h2>and this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the darkness of the alcove and room.</h2>
