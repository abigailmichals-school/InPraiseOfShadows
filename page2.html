        <h2>In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to throw a shadow on the earth,</h2>
        <h2>and in the pale light of the shadow we put together a house. </h2>
        <h2>There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew;</h2>
        <h2>even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as possible.</h2>
        <h2> If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol,</h2>
        <h2>the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap,</h2>
        <h2>with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.</h2>
        <h2>There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. </h2>
        <h2>The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the driving wind and rain.</h2>
        <h2>A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, too,</h2>
        <h2>than a dark room.</h2>
        <h2>The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life,</h2>
        <h2>and our ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, </h2>
        <h2>presently came to discover beauty in shadows,</h2>
        <h2>ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.</h2>
