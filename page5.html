        <span class="line1">We have all had the experience,</span>
        <span class="line2">on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of being shown a scroll,</span>
        <span class="line3">one of the temple's treasures,</span>
        <span class="line4">hanging in a large, deeply recessed alcove.</span>
        <span class="line5">So dark are these alcoves,</span>
        <span class="line6"> even in bright daylight,</span>
        <span class="line7"> that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we can do is listen to the explanation of the guide,</span>
        <span class="line8"> follow as best we can the all-but invisible brush strokes,</span>
        <span class="line9"> and tell ourselves how magnificent a painting it must be.</span>
        <span class="line10"> Yet the combination of that</span>
        <!-- <span class="blurred">blurred</span> -->
        <span class="line11">blurred old painting and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony.</span>
        <span class="line12"> The lack of clarity, far from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.</span>
